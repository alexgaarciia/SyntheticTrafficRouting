# SyntheticTrafficRouting

This project focuses on generating synthetic network traffic data and evaluating its reliability for network routing tasks, particularly traffic flow management. The project demonstrates the application of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGANs)** to generate synthetic datasets and assess key metrics such as total link load on the shortest paths and the distribution of traffic across the network. 


## Overview

Efficient network traffic management relies on accurate simulations of traffic behavior. Generating synthetic traffic matrices is crucial when real traffic data is scarce, sensitive, or limited. In this project, we utilize GANs and CTGANs to generate realistic traffic matrices for the **US Abilene network topology**:

The generated synthetic data is evaluated for its reliability in simulating real-world conditions by measuring key metrics such as:

- Statistical similarity to real data
- Link load across shortest paths
- Distribution of traffic demands


This repository provides the code for:

- Training GANs and CTGANs on traffic data
- Evaluating generated traffic matrices using statistical similarity and network performance metrics



## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the code:

- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- matplotlib 
- scikit-learn
- SDV

To install the required libraries, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/SyntheticTrafficRouting.git
cd SyntheticTrafficRouting
```
Install the required libraries (see Requirements).

## Dataset

The code utilizes real-world traffic matrices from the publicly available the Survivable Network Design Library ([SNDlib](https://sndlib.put.poznan.pl/)). The dataset contains traffic matrices recorded at 5-minute intervals over a 6-month period.

The original dataset is rescaled to match current traffic growth trends, using the formula:

$demand_{scaled} = demand_{original} Ã— (1 + 0.45)^{(2025 - 2004)}$


This transformation ensures that the synthetic data remains relevant to contemporary traffic conditions.

## Key Methodology

**GAN Architecture**: The GAN consists of a generator and a discriminator, where the generator outputs realistic traffic demand values. Categorical features (e.g., source and target nodes) and numerical traffic demands are modeled to closely reflect real-world conditions.

**CTGAN**: from the SDV library captures conditional dependencies in the dataset, producing more realistic synthetic traffic distributions.

We evaluated the generated synthetic traffic matrices against real traffic data from the US Abilene network using:

- **Statistical Quality**: The GAN achieved an 85% quality score, while the CTGAN reached 82%, demonstrating good preservation of statistical properties.
- **Mean Absolute Difference (MAD)**: GAN (8063.9 Gb/s), CTGAN (4620.7 Gb/s)
- **Mean Relative Difference (MRD)**: GAN (5.8%), CTGAN (2.4%)
